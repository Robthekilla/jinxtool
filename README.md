# jinxtool
This is a tool made to be helpful for people that (still) grief minecraft servers. It has some simple functions like port scanning etc. It is obfuscated because of people that want to steal the code, and it is made in batch.
If you get any errors while using this tool, make sure to message me on discord ( jinx#6828 ).
If you get in any sort of trouble or cause any damage to somenthing or someone i have nothing to do with that, this tool is for educational and for educational
purposes only, everything you do you take the punishment for. Enjoy using the tool. :]
